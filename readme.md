# Passpad
Passpad is a tool to help you make and store codes.

## How it works
This tool takes a list of words you give it and creates a grid. You use the grid to make your password. You record the coordinates you used to make the password. The password can only be guessed if you have the grid and the coordinates.

Think of it like this: Your grid is a treasure map, and the coordinates are X marking the spot.

## Passpad Usage
1. Create a file with separate words you want to use on each line.

Example:
```
have
that
for
you
with
say
this
```
2. 

## makeGrid.py
```
python makeGrid.py dictCommonCompounds.csv
```
